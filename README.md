# plantfinder
A project for a program to help people make good gardening choices

This project is kind of ambitious, so I'm trying to break it into small steps:

-create a program that lets people search for edible garden plants based on their interests and regional information
    -coding this in Python3; I have the basic code almost finished
-embed the program in a GUI or website
    -honestly, I'm not sure how to do this yet; if Python turns out not to be the best language for this, I may have to rewrite in JavaScript
    -instead of only text-based input, the program will respond to actions taken on the website; gathering responses from users in the form of checked radio buttons, or menu dropdows
    -return a webpage with relevant information on it, selected from a larger dataset by the program
    -give the user the option to return and search again
    
This list of steps will probably change as I figure out how exactly to do the web-based aspect of this project.
